# Spine + Unity: Vertice Animation Issue

While attempting to play Spine animations in Unity using `Timeline playables` and `Addressables` loading, I encountered an issue with Timeline tracks that contain Spine animations with simple `vertice animation` â€“ these animations do not function as expected.

To facilitate the demonstration and explanation of the problem, I have recorded videos below, showcasing how the animation was created and the current attempt to play them in Unity.

If you have any questions or require further clarification, please feel free to reach out. Thank you!
